Besides academic life,
I enjoy anime and games.
My favorite three anime are

[Fate/Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/Zero)
and
[Your Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name).
For PC games,
I prefer
[Soulslike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulslike)
and
[Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania),
and my top three are

[Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice)
and
[Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring).
I also play
[Arknights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights),
a "free-to-play" tactical RPG and tower defense game on cell phones.
