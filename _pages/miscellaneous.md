## Anime and Games
Besides academic life,
I enjoy anime and games.
My favorite three anime are
[K-ON!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-On!),
[Fate/Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate/Zero)
and
[Your Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name).
For PC games,
I prefer
[Soulslike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulslike)
and
[Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania),
and my top three are
[Hollow Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight),
[Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice)
and
[Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring).
I also play
[Arknights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights),
a "free-to-play" tactical RPG and tower defense mobile game.

## Recent Goals
I used to stay up late and get up late.
I have been struggling to keep a healthy circadian clock and clock in
[my Bangumi post](https://bgm.tv/group/topic/373255).

Also,
as I spend at least three hours a day cooking,
I am trying to watch at least one movie simultaneously to empty
[my wishlist](https://movie.douban.com/people/58233543/wish) before 2023.
