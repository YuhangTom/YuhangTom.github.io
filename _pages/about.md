I am a Ph.D. student in [Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University (ISU)](https://www.iastate.edu/).
I received my B.Sc. and M.Phil. in [Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/) from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).

My research interest is forensic statistics and statistical inference for incomplete data.
Currently,
I am working on a project related to firearms and toolmark analysis at the [Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE)](https://forensicstats.org/).
