# Welcome!

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Iowa State University (ISU), graduating in May 2026. I am actively seeking a full-time position as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Statistician, Biostatistician, or Data Analyst where I can apply my expertise in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data-driven decision-making to solve complex challenges.

My academic journey, including an M.Phil. and B.Sc. (Hons.) First Class in Statistics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has provided me with a robust foundation in statistical theory and practice. I am proficient in R, Python, and SQL.

- Current role: Statistician at Corteva, where I apply advanced statistical methods in machine learning, data analysis, and experimental design to support research and decision-making.
- Previous experience: CMC Statistics and Product Quality Intern at Amgen, where I automated the analysis pipeline, developed R Shiny applications, and leveraged statistical modeling to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

I am eager to bring my skills and research experience to an industry setting and contribute to data-driven innovation. Please feel free to connect with me or reach out directly regarding potential opportunities.
